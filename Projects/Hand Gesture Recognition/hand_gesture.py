# Python file which recognizes the number of fingers raised on a hand
# using OpenCV


# Steps Involved
# 1) Segmentation -> Extracting objects of interest
# How to segment? - Find the color of the user's skin and use it to binarize
# the image

# 1a) How to find the color of the skin?
# - The user has tp place his hand in a designated rectangle
# - The s key on the keyboard saves the images in the rectangle area
# - The 2 average colors are used as the lower and upper thresholds and are used
#   to find the user's skin
